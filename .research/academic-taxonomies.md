## 1. Biber's Multi-Dimensional Analysis (MDA)

**Originator:** Douglas Biber
**Key Publication:** *Variation across Speech and Writing* (Cambridge University Press, 1988); "A typology of English texts" (1989)

### Overview

Biber's MDA is a corpus-linguistic methodology that uses factor analysis on co-occurring linguistic features across large text corpora to identify underlying dimensions of variation. It is the most influential quantitative approach to text typology.

### Six Dimensions of Variation

Each dimension is a continuum defined by clusters of co-occurring linguistic features:

| Dimension | Poles | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **D1: Involved vs. Informational Production** | Involved (+) / Informational (-) | Positive: 1st/2nd person pronouns, contractions, private verbs (believe, think), that-deletion, present tense. Negative: nouns, long words, prepositions, type-token ratio, nominalizations, passives. Conversations score high positive; academic prose scores high negative. |
| **D2: Narrative vs. Non-Narrative Concerns** | Narrative (+) / Non-Narrative (-) | Positive: past tense, 3rd person pronouns, perfect aspect. Fiction and biography score high positive; technical prose scores negative. |
| **D3: Explicit vs. Situation-Dependent Reference** | Explicit (+) / Situated (-) | Positive: WH-relative clauses, nominalization, phrasal coordination. High: official documents, professional letters. Low: broadcasts, spontaneous speech. |
| **D4: Overt Expression of Persuasion** | Persuasive (+) / Non-Persuasive (-) | Positive: infinitives, prediction modals, suasive verbs, conditional subordination. High: editorials, professional letters. |
| **D5: Abstract vs. Non-Abstract Information** | Abstract (+) / Non-Abstract (-) | Positive: conjuncts, agentless passives, past participial clauses, by-passives. High: technical, scientific prose. |
| **D6: On-Line Informational Elaboration** | Elaborated (+) / Non-Elaborated (-) | Positive: that-clauses on object position, demonstratives. Associated with real-time informational production (e.g., prepared speeches, interviews). |

### Eight Text Types (Cluster Analysis, 1989)

Using cluster analysis on the six dimensions, Biber identified eight text types that cut across traditional genre boundaries:

1. **Intimate Interpersonal Interaction** -- face-to-face conversation, personal letters
2. **Informational Interaction** -- interviews, panel discussions
3. **Scientific Exposition** -- academic journals, technical reports
4. **Learned Exposition** -- official documents, press reviews
5. **Imaginative Narrative** -- fiction (novels, short stories)
6. **General Narrative Exposition** -- biographies, press reportage
7. **Situated Reportage** -- sports broadcasts, play-by-play commentary
8. **Involved Persuasion** -- editorials, professional letters, spontaneous speeches

### Cross-Linguistic Universals

Two dimensions have emerged across nearly all languages studied:
- Clausal/oral discourse vs. phrasal/literate discourse (analogous to D1)
- Narrative vs. non-narrative discourse (analogous to D2)

## 2. Classical Rhetoric: Levels and Virtues of Style

### Three Levels of Style (Genera Dicendi)

**Originators:** Developed in the Greek rhetorical tradition, codified by Cicero (*Orator*, c. 46 BCE), Quintilian (*Institutio Oratoria*, c. 95 CE), and later Augustine.

| Level | Latin Term | Purpose | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Plain (Low)** | *Genus tenue* | To instruct / inform | Clarity, simplicity, minimal ornamentation. Associated with philosophical dialectic. Goal: to be understood. |
| **Middle (Moderate)** | *Genus medium / mediocre* | To delight / please | Moderate ornamentation, balanced rhythm, charm. Goal: to be enjoyable. |
| **Grand (High)** | *Genus grande / sublime* | To move / persuade | Rich figurative language (metaphor, simile, personification), emotional power, amplification. Goal: to stir the emotions and compel action. |

Augustine's formulation: The plain style teaches, the middle style pleases, the grand style persuades.

Cicero argued the ideal orator masters all three and selects the appropriate level for the occasion.

### Four Virtues of Style (Virtutes Elocutionis)

**Originators:** Aristotle identified three virtues in *Rhetoric* (c. 350 BCE); Theophrastus (his student) formalized all four. Adopted by Cicero and Quintilian.

| Virtue | Greek/Latin | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Correctness (Purity)** | *Hellenismos / Latinitas* | Grammatically correct language conforming to the standards of the linguistic community |
| **Clarity** | *Sapheneia / Perspicuitas* | Language that is immediately understandable; avoidance of ambiguity and obscurity |
| **Appropriateness (Propriety)** | *To prepon / Aptum* | Fitting style to subject, audience, occasion, and speaker's persona; decorum |
| **Ornament** | *Kataskeuē / Ornatus* | Use of figures of speech and thought to give language distinction and beauty |

---

## 3. Modes of Discourse (Rhetorical Modes)

### Bain's Four Modes of Discourse

**Originator:** Alexander Bain
**Key Publication:** *English Composition and Rhetoric* (1866)

Bain's classification has dominated writing instruction for over 150 years and remains the foundation of most composition curricula:

| Mode | Purpose | Key Features |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Narration** | To tell a story or recount events | Chronological sequence, characters, conflict, point of view, temporal markers |
| **Description** | To create a vivid sensory picture | Sensory detail, spatial organization, figurative language, showing vs. telling |
| **Exposition** | To explain, inform, or analyze | Logical organization, evidence, clarity. Sub-modes: definition, classification, comparison/contrast, cause/effect, process analysis |
| **Argumentation (Persuasion)** | To convince the reader | Claims, evidence, reasoning, counterarguments, appeals (logos, ethos, pathos) |

Bain connected these to mental faculties: Description, Narration, and Exposition inform the understanding; Oratory moves the will; Poetry engages feeling.

In practice, most effective writing blends multiple modes.

## 4. Britton's Function Categories

**Originator:** James Britton
**Key Publication:** *The Development of Writing Abilities, 11-18* (1975, with Burgess, Martin, McLeod, Rosen)

### Three Functions of Writing

Britton's framework classifies writing by its function (purpose) rather than its form, based on the role the writer adopts:

| Function | Writer's Role | Reader's Stance | Description |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Transactional** | Participant | Piecemeal interpretation | Writing that gets things done in the world: informing, persuading, instructing, reporting. The writer participates in events and aims to communicate information or achieve a practical outcome. Examples: reports, essays, letters, instructions. |
| **Expressive** | Self (middle ground) | Both participant and spectator | Writing close to the self -- exploratory, reflective, personal. Language "close to the speaker." Occupies the center of the spectrum. Examples: journals, personal letters, diaries, freewriting. |
| **Poetic** | Spectator | Global/aesthetic interpretation | Writing as verbal art -- the text is an end in itself. The reader experiences the whole as an aesthetic object. Examples: poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction, literary essays. |

### Key Insight

Britton placed expressive writing at the center, arguing it is the matrix from which both transactional and poetic writing develop. Children begin with expressive writing and gradually differentiate toward the other two functions.

## 5. Kinneavy's Aims of Discourse

**Originator:** James Kinneavy
**Key Publication:** *A Theory of Discourse: The Aims of Discourse* (1971)

### The Communication Triangle

Kinneavy built on Jakobson's communication model, identifying four aims based on which element of the communication triangle is emphasized:

| Aim | Emphasis | Description | Examples |
|-----|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Expressive** | Encoder (writer) | Emphasizes the writer's self-expression, identity, and personal experience | Journals, manifestos, declarations, personal blogs, Romantic literature |
| **Referential** | Reality (subject) | Emphasizes accurate representation of the external world | Textbooks, scientific reports, news articles, encyclopedias |
| **Persuasive** | Decoder (reader) | Aims to effect change in the reader's beliefs or actions | Advertisements, political speeches, editorials, propaganda |
| **Literary** | Signal (language itself) | Emphasizes the verbal medium; language used for its own aesthetic qualities | Poetry, fiction, drama, literary essays |

### Sub-Categories of Referential Discourse

Kinneavy further divided referential discourse into:
- **Exploratory** -- seeking new knowledge
- **Scientific** -- proving or demonstrating
- **Informative** -- transmitting established knowledge

### Critical Note

Later scholars observed that most real texts serve multiple aims simultaneously, with one predominating and others subordinated.

## 6. Halliday's Register Theory (Systemic Functional Linguistics)

**Originator:** M.A.K. Halliday
**Key Publications:** *Language as Social Semiotic* (1978); *An Introduction to Functional Grammar* (1985; revised editions with Matthiessen)

### Register Variables

Halliday's framework classifies language variation by the situational context in which it occurs, using three variables:

| Variable | Question | Relates To | Examples of Variation |
|----------|----------|------------|----------------------|
| **Field** | What is being talked about? | Ideational meaning (content) | Science, law, sports, cooking, medicine. Determines technical vocabulary, degree of specialization. |
| **Tenor** | Who are the participants and what is their relationship? | Interpersonal meaning (social roles) | Formal/informal, expert/novice, power relations, social distance. Determines modality, mood, person, politeness markers. |
| **Mode** | What role is language playing? | Textual meaning (channel and medium) | Spoken/written, monologue/dialogue, prepared/spontaneous, constitutive/ancillary. Determines information structure, cohesion, lexical density. |

### Application to Style

A "register" is a particular configuration of field, tenor, and mode. What we informally call "style" largely corresponds to the tenor and mode variables. Changes in any variable produce a different register, which manifests as different lexicogrammatical choices.

### Genre vs. Register

In the Sydney School extension of Halliday's work (Martin, 1992), genre sits above register as a higher-level cultural pattern -- a staged, goal-oriented social process. Genre determines register choices.

## 7. The 6+1 Traits of Writing

**Originators:** Vicki Spandel and the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory (now Education Northwest), 1984. Based on Paul Diederich's earlier research at ETS (1974).
**Key Publication:** Ruth Culham, *6+1 Traits of Writing: The Complete Guide* (2003)

### The Seven Traits

This is primarily an assessment and instructional framework rather than a taxonomy of styles, but it defines the components that constitute writing quality:

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Ideas** | The main message, theme, and supporting details. Showing rather than telling. Clarity, focus, and development of the central topic. |
| **Organization** | The internal structure -- the thread of central meaning, the pattern, the sequence. Includes effective leads, transitions, and conclusions. |
| **Voice** | The personal tone, flavor, and style of the writer. The individual quality that makes writing come alive. Connects writer to reader. Varies from formal to informal, serious to humorous, passionate to detached. |
| **Word Choice** | Precision, vividness, and naturalness of language. Rich, colorful, exact vocabulary used with intent. |
| **Sentence Fluency** | The rhythm and flow of language. Variation in sentence length, structure, and beginnings. Writing that sounds natural when read aloud. |
| **Conventions** | Mechanical correctness: spelling, punctuation, capitalization, grammar, paragraphing. |
| **+1: Presentation** | The visual appearance: handwriting/typography, formatting, white space, layout. |

### Relevance to Writing Style

Of these traits, **Voice** is most directly related to writing style. The framework treats voice as comprising:
- Audience awareness (formal/informal register)
- Authorial presence (strong/muted personal engagement)
- Tone (serious, playful, persuasive, reflective)
- Risk-taking vs. safe writing

## 8. Stylometry / Computational Stylistics

**Key Figures:** John Burrows, Hugh Craig, Maciej Eder, Jan Rybicki, Matthew Jockers
**Key Publications:** Burrows, "Delta: A Measure of Stylistic Difference" (2002); Eder et al., "Stylometry with R" (2016)

### Overview

Stylometry is the quantitative analysis of linguistic style. Rather than proposing a fixed taxonomy, it identifies the features that distinguish individual and group writing styles through statistical analysis.

### Feature Categories Used to Distinguish Styles

| Category | Features | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Lexical (word-level)** | Average word length, vocabulary richness (type-token ratio, hapax legomena, hapax dislegomena), Yule's K, Simpson's D, Honore's R, entropy | Vocabulary richness measures are among the most reliable style discriminators |
| **Function words** | Frequencies of articles, prepositions, pronouns, conjunctions, auxiliary verbs | Function words are the strongest signals of individual style because they are used unconsciously and are content-independent |
| **Syntactic** | Sentence length distribution, clause complexity, subordination ratio, part-of-speech n-grams | Captures structural preferences |
| **Punctuation** | Frequency and patterns of commas, semicolons, dashes, parentheses, exclamation marks | Surprisingly distinctive across authors |
| **Character n-grams** | Bi-gram, tri-gram, quad-gram character sequences | Captures spelling habits, morphological preferences |
| **Readability** | Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog, Coleman-Liau indices | Composite measures of sentence and word complexity |

### Key Method: Burrows' Delta

The most widely used distance metric in computational stylistics. It compares the frequencies of the most frequent words (typically 100-5000) between texts using z-scores and Manhattan distance. Largely content-independent, it is sensitive to "latent stylistic fingerprints."

### What Stylometric Clusters Reveal

Large-scale analyses consistently find that:
- **Authorship** is the strongest signal (individual style overrides genre/period)
- **Genre/register** is the second strongest signal
- **Historical period** and **national tradition** also produce detectable clusters
- **Gender** shows some statistical differences (contested and context-dependent)

## 9. Additional Frameworks

### Flower & Hayes: Cognitive Process Theory of Writing (1981)

Not a style taxonomy per se, but influential in understanding how writing style emerges from cognitive processes:
- **Planning** (generating, organizing, goal-setting)
- **Translating** (turning plans into text)
- **Reviewing** (evaluating and revising)

Related: Bereiter & Scardamalia's distinction between **knowledge-telling** (novice: linearly retrieving and reporting information) and **knowledge-transforming** (expert: actively restructuring understanding through writing). These map to recognizable style differences between immature and mature writing.

### Peter Elbow: Writing with Power (1981)

Elbow's work centers on **voice** as the primary source of power in writing. Key concepts:
- Freewriting as a method to access authentic voice
- The tension between the "first-order thinking" (creative, generative) and "second-order thinking" (critical, editing)
- Voice as the sound, texture, and rhythm unique to each writer
- Distinction between **personal/authentic voice** and **institutional/academic voice**

### The Geneva School: Text Types (Jean-Paul Bronckart, 1997)

Five text types based on discourse operations:
1. **Narrative** -- temporal organization of events
2. **Interactive dialogue** -- conversational exchange
3. **Theoretical discourse** -- autonomous reasoning
4. **Report** -- chronological account anchored to external time
5. **Descriptive** -- spatial and attributive organization

### Werlich's Text Types (1976)

Egon Werlich proposed five basic text types defined by their dominant cognitive operation:

| Text Type | Cognitive Basis | Focus |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| **Descriptive** | Perception in space | Qualities, attributes, spatial relations |
| **Narrative** | Perception in time | Events, actions, temporal sequence |
| **Expository** | Comprehension (analysis/synthesis) | Concepts, classifications, explanations |
| **Argumentative** | Judging | Claims, reasons, evaluation |
| **Instructive** | Planning future behavior | Directions, procedures, commands |

## Summary: Mapping Across Frameworks

These frameworks address style at different levels:

| Level | Frameworks | What They Classify |
|-------|------------|-------------------|
| **Micro-linguistic features** | Stylometry, Biber MDA | Quantifiable textual properties (word frequency, sentence length, etc.) |
| **Register / Situation** | Halliday (Field/Tenor/Mode), Biber dimensions | How context shapes language choices |
| **Text type / Mode** | Bain, Werlich, Bronckart | Underlying cognitive/discourse operations |
| **Function / Aim** | Britton, Kinneavy | Writer's purpose and relationship to audience |
| **Quality / Craft** | 6+1 Traits, Elbow, Classical Virtues | What makes writing effective |
| **Level / Register** | Classical Rhetoric (genera dicendi) | Degree of formality and ornamentation |

No single framework captures all dimensions of "writing style." A comprehensive system would need to integrate insights across these levels -- accounting for the writer's purpose (Kinneavy/Britton), the situational register (Halliday), the discourse type (Werlich/Bain), the quantifiable linguistic texture (Biber/stylometry), and the qualitative craft dimensions (6+1 Traits, classical virtues).
