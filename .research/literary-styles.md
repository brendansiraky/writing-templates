## 1. Classical Rhetorical Style Taxonomy

The oldest and most durable framework for categorizing prose style comes from classical rhetoric. These categories remain foundational in literary criticism.

### The Three Genera Dicendi (Classical Levels of Style)

| Style | Also Called | Characteristics | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| **Plain (Low)** | Attic style | Clarity, brevity, sincerity; short declarative sentences; everyday diction | To teach or inform |
| **Middle** | Rhodian style | Balance between ornament and simplicity; moderate complexity | To please or entertain |
| **Grand (High)** | Asiatic style | Copious, ornate, elaborate; complex syntax; elevated diction | To move or persuade |

**Key sources**: Cicero's *Orator*; Quintilian's *Institutio Oratoria*; Augustine's *De Doctrina Christiana*

### Sentence-Level Style Categories

| Category | Definition | Practitioners |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Paratactic** | Coordinate clauses placed side by side without subordination; "and...and...and" | Hemingway, the Bible (KJV), Gertrude Stein |
| **Hypotactic** | Subordinate clause structures clarifying relationships (cause, time, condition) | Henry James, Proust, academic prose |
| **Periodic** | Sentence withholds grammatical completion until the end; builds suspense | Cicero, Milton, MLK's speeches |
| **Cumulative (Loose)** | Main clause first, then trailing modifiers and additions | Most conversational prose; Didion, Wolfe |
| **Curt/Pointed** | Short, epigrammatic sentences; antithesis and balance | Bacon, La Rochefoucauld, Orwell |

**Key sources**: Richard Lanham, *Analyzing Prose* (2003); Virginia Tufte, *Artful Sentences: Syntax as Style* (2006)

## 2. Thomas & Turner's Prose Style Taxonomy

Francis-Noel Thomas and Mark Turner's *Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose* (1994, 2nd ed. 2011) offers the most rigorous modern taxonomy of intellectual prose styles. They define style not as technique but as an attitude toward the relationship between writer, reader, truth, and language.

| Style | Stance | Motive | Model Reader | Key Feature |
|-------|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Classic** | Writer sees something, presents it to reader | Truth | Intellectual equal | Language as a window; confidence without arrogance |
| **Practical** | Writer has a job to get done | Getting things done | Someone who needs instructions | Clarity in service of action |
| **Plain** | Writer states what is obvious | Stating what everyone knows | Competent adult | Simplicity as honesty |
| **Contemplative** | Writer reflects on inner experience | Understanding | Fellow thinker | Tentative, exploratory |
| **Romantic** | Writer has special insight or feeling | Self-expression | Admiring audience | Emphasis on the writer's unique perception |
| **Prophetic** | Writer channels a higher truth | Revelation | Disciple or congregation | Urgency, authority from beyond the self |
| **Reflexive (Academic)** | Writer examines the means of expression itself | Qualification and precision | Expert peer | Hedging, footnotes, meta-commentary |
| **Oratorical** | Writer performs for an audience | Persuasion | Crowd or audience | Rhythm, repetition, emotional crescendo |

**Classic style practitioners**: Descartes, Pascal, Madame de Sevigne, the pre-1985 *New Yorker*
**Key source**: Thomas & Turner, *Clear and Simple as the Truth* (Princeton UP)

## 4. Famous Prose Stylists and Their Signatures

### Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961)
- **Style label**: Minimalist; paratactic; plain style
- **Sentence structure**: Short declarative sentences building on each other. Avoids colons, semicolons, dashes, parentheses.
- **Diction**: Simple, concrete, Anglo-Saxon vocabulary. Specific nouns and active verbs.
- **Perspective**: Often third-person limited; restrained interiority.
- **Signature technique**: The "iceberg theory" -- omission as meaning. What characters don't say matters more than what they do.
- **Key source**: Hemingway, *Death in the Afternoon* (1932) on the iceberg theory

### Joan Didion (1934-2021)
- **Style label**: New Journalism; classic prose; observational minimalism
- **Sentence structure**: Alternates between wandering, recursive, comma-heavy sentences and sudden staccato clarity. Cumulative style.
- **Diction**: Insistently concrete; precise. Specificity masks and reveals the universal.
- **Perspective**: First person; the observing consciousness as subject.
- **Signature technique**: Grammar as power -- "To shift the structure of a sentence alters the meaning of that sentence, as definitely and inflexibly as the position of a camera alters the meaning of the object photographed."
- **Key sources**: Didion, "Why I Write" (1976); "The White Album" (1979)

### George Orwell (1903-1950)
- **Style label**: Plain style; political clarity
- **Sentence structure**: Short, declarative sentences. Logical, linear structure. Active voice.
- **Diction**: Everyday English; concrete nouns; avoids jargon, foreign phrases, and abstract terminology.
- **Perspective**: First person (essays) or close third (fiction). Moral authority through transparency.
- **Signature technique**: Prose as "window-pane" -- language should be transparent to meaning. Clarity as a political act against manipulation.
- **Six rules** (from "Politics and the English Language," 1946):
  1. Never use a worn-out metaphor or simile
  2. Never use a long word where a short one will do
  3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out
  4. Never use the passive where you can use the active
  5. Never use jargon if you can think of an everyday equivalent
  6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything barbarous

### John McPhee (b. 1931)
- **Style label**: Literary nonfiction; classic prose; structural mastery
- **Sentence structure**: Varied; cumulative sentences. Each word chosen for meaning, musicality, and relation to surrounding words.
- **Diction**: Precise; ravenous gathering of facts rendered with economy. Uncanny similes and metaphors that are "surprising as they are precise."
- **Perspective**: Third person or restrained first person; the writer as guide.

### David Foster Wallace (1962-2008)
- **Style label**: Maximalist; hysterical realism; postmodern sincerity
- **Sentence structure**: Extremely long, hypotactic sentences. Extensive use of footnotes and endnotes. Parenthetical digressions within digressions.
- **Diction**: Range from academic/technical jargon to slang within the same paragraph. Precise and encyclopedic.

### Cormac McCarthy (1933-2023)
- **Style label**: Biblical maximalism; Southern Gothic; plain-grand hybrid
- **Sentence structure**: Long, unpunctuated, polysyndetic sentences ("and...and...and"). No quotation marks for dialogue. Minimal punctuation.
- **Diction**: Archaic and biblical vocabulary alongside sparse, plain description. Latinate words in nature descriptions; Anglo-Saxon in violence.
- **Perspective**: Close third person; omniscient. Detached, almost geological perspective on human events.
- **Signature technique**: Landscape as character. Violence rendered with clinical beauty. The absence of punctuation creating an incantatory, mythic flow.

### Virginia Woolf (1882-1941)
- **Style label**: Modernist; stream of consciousness; lyrical prose
- **Sentence structure**: Long, flowing, associative sentences that track consciousness. Semicolons and parentheses create layers.
- **Diction**: Sensory, impressionistic, musical.
- **Perspective**: Free indirect discourse; moves fluidly between characters' interior lives.

## 6. Creative Writing Pedagogy: How Craft Books Classify Style

### Ursula K. Le Guin -- *Steering the Craft* (1998, revised 2015)

Le Guin organizes craft around the **fundamental components of narrative**. She does not classify "styles" as fixed categories but instead treats style as emerging from choices in these elements:

1. **The Sound of Your Writing** -- rhythm, repetition, musicality
2. **Punctuation and Grammar** -- how sentence mechanics shape meaning
3. **Sentence Length and Complexity** -- the choice between long and short
4. **Repetition** -- deliberate patterning vs. unconscious echoing
5. **Adjective and Adverb Use** -- "Chastity" exercise: write with none
6. **Verb Choices** -- active vs. passive; strong vs. weak verbs
7. **Point of View** -- first, second, third person; limited vs. omniscient
8. **Voice and Indirect Discourse** -- who is speaking and how

Notable exercises: "I am Garcia Marquez" (write without punctuation); "Chastity" (no adjectives or adverbs); "A Terrible Thing to Do" (cut a piece by half).

### Verlyn Klinkenborg -- *Several Short Sentences About Writing* (2012)

Klinkenborg's approach is iconoclastic and anti-taxonomic. Core principles:

- **The sentence is the fundamental unit of writing**, not the paragraph or the outline
- "All writing is revision and good writing is just one strong sentence after another"
- Eliminate transitions and conjunctions; split compound sentences; don't save your point for the end
- Revise by deleting
- **Noticing** -- "thinking with all your senses"
- Rejects traditional rules (no fussiness about passive voice, split infinitives, etc.)
- No gospel, no orthodoxy -- "a gathering of starting points"

Klinkenborg implicitly advocates for a **plain, paratactic style** built from short, self-sufficient sentences.

### William Zinsser -- *On Writing Well* (1976, many revised editions)

Zinsser classifies nonfiction writing by **form** (genre) rather than by style per se, but within each form he identifies stylistic principles:

- **Part I: Principles** -- simplicity, clutter, style, the audience, words, usage
- **Part II: Methods** -- unity, the lead, the ending
- **Part III: Forms** -- travel, memoir, science/technology, business, sports, arts criticism, humor
- **Part IV: Attitudes** -- the sound of your voice, enjoyment, confidence, the tyranny of the final product

Key stylistic principle: **Strip every sentence to its cleanest components.** Every word that serves no function should be removed.

### Strunk & White -- *The Elements of Style* (1918 / 1959)

The foundational prescriptive style guide. Key principles:

- "Omit needless words"
- Use the active voice
- Put statements in positive form
- Use definite, specific, concrete language
- Avoid fancy words; do not use dialect unless your ear is good
- "Place yourself in the background" -- the writer should not draw attention to their own presence

Advocates for a **plain, clear, concise** style. Often contrasted with more expansive approaches.

### Other Notable Craft Texts on Style

| Book | Author | Key Contribution |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| *Clear and Simple as the Truth* | Thomas & Turner | Taxonomy of intellectual prose styles (see Section 2 above) |
| *The Art of the Personal Essay* | Phillip Lopate | Defines and anthologizes the personal essay tradition from Seneca to the present |
| *Reading Like a Writer* | Francine Prose | Close reading as the basis of style development; sentence-level analysis |
| *Artful Sentences: Syntax as Style* | Virginia Tufte | Encyclopedic analysis of how syntax creates meaning and style |
| *Craft in the Real World* | Matthew Salesses | Critiques workshop conventions and their hidden style norms |
| *Meander, Spiral, Explode* | Jane Alison | Alternative narrative structures to the conventional arc |

## 7. "Workshop Fiction" and the MFA Style

A significant contemporary critique concerns the emergence of a homogeneous "MFA style" or "workshop fiction":

**Characteristics of workshop fiction** (per Erik Hoel and other critics):
- Minimalism and brevity (to "shrink the attack surface" for critique)
- Well-polished prose with "the occasional pleasing turn of phrase, but never distinctive, never flowery nor reaching"
- Narrow realism; domestic settings; epiphanic structure
- Restraint valued over ambition
- Focus on "showing not telling" and "finding your voice" as institutional mantras

This is not a recognized literary style per se, but a critical label for the institutional tendency of MFA programs to produce stylistically similar prose.

**Key critical sources**:
- Mark McGurl, *The Program Era: Postwar Fiction and the Rise of Creative Writing* (2009)
- Chad Harbach, ed., *MFA vs NYC* (2014)
- Erik Hoel, "How the MFA Swallowed Literature" (2022)

## 8. Voice in Publishing: How Agents and Editors Describe Style

### What Agents Mean by "Voice"

Literary agents consistently rank **voice** as the most desirable quality in a manuscript. Key aspects:

- **Voice is the first thing that grabs an agent**. When fiction has "a great voice," the prose is "distinct in a way that feels individual, unique, with a narrator who gets right into the reader's head."
- Agents describe voice as having two ingredients: **content** (the writer's perspective of the world) and **delivery** (how it's communicated -- style and tone).
- Common agent language: "compelling voice," "strong voice," "wonderful, engaging voice," "distinctive voice," "fresh voice"

### Three Layers of Voice

Editors and craft teachers distinguish:

1. **Author Voice**: The writer's unique attitude, personality, and worldview, forged from lived experience and conveyed by their writing style. This persists across works.
2. **Narrator Voice**: The specific voice telling a particular story -- may differ from the author's own.
3. **Character Voice**: How individual characters speak and think -- dialogue, interiority, idiolect.

### Industry Descriptors for Style/Voice

Common terms agents and editors use when describing prose:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Lyrical** | Musical, poetic, rhythmic prose |
| **Spare** | Lean, stripped-down, economical |
| **Lush** | Rich, sensory, ornate |
| **Propulsive** | Fast-paced, forward-moving, compulsive readability |
| **Atmospheric** | Strong sense of place and mood |
| **Wry** | Dry humor; understated irony |
| **Muscular** | Strong, direct, forceful |
| **Intimate** | Close, confessional, personal |
| **Incisive** | Sharp, precise, cutting |
| **Effervescent** | Light, sparkling, energetic |
| **Meditative** | Slow, reflective, contemplative |
| **Unflinching** | Doesn't look away from difficult material |
| **Cinematic** | Visual, scene-based, camera-like |
| **Literary** | (vague catch-all) Stylistically ambitious; prose-focused |

Paratactic (coordinate) --- Mixed --- Hypotactic (subordinate)
(Hemingway, Bible, Stein) --- (Didion, McPhee) --- (Henry James, Proust, DFW)

### Axis 3: Narrator Presence
Effaced / Transparent --- Observing / Restrained --- Central / Performative
(Orwell, Strunk & White ideal) --- (McPhee, Didion) --- (Thompson, DFW, Knausgaard)

### Axis 4: Relationship to Reality
Strict Realism --- Heightened / Lyrical --- Surreal / Fantastic
(Carver, Chekhov) --- (Morrison, McCarthy) --- (Marquez, Borges, Barthelme)

### Axis 5: Stance (Thomas & Turner)
Classic --- Plain --- Romantic --- Contemplative --- Reflexive --- Prophetic

### Axis 6: Sentence Rhythm
Curt / Pointed --- Cumulative / Loose --- Periodic / Suspensive
(Orwell, Bacon) --- (Didion, most prose) --- (MLK, Cicero, Milton)
