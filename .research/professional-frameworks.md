## 1. Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g) -- Four Dimensions of Tone of Voice

**Originator:** Nielsen Norman Group (Kate Moran), published 2016
**Source:** [The Four Dimensions of Tone of Voice](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tone-of-voice-dimensions/)

### The Framework

Any piece of digital content can be analyzed along four bipolar dimensions (spectrum sliders):

| Dimension | Pole A | Pole B |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Humor** | Funny | Serious |
| **Formality** | Formal | Casual |
| **Respectfulness** | Respectful | Irreverent |
| **Enthusiasm** | Enthusiastic | Matter-of-fact |

### What Distinguishes Each Dimension

- **Formal vs. Casual:** Formal uses sophisticated vocabulary and complete grammatical structures. Casual uses contractions, colloquial language, and conversational phrasing.
- **Funny vs. Serious:** Funny incorporates humor, playfulness, and lightheartedness. Serious is straightforward and businesslike.
- **Respectful vs. Irreverent:** Respectful is earnest and polite. Irreverent is cheeky and challenges conventions.
- **Enthusiastic vs. Matter-of-fact:** Enthusiastic celebrates ("You did it!"). Matter-of-fact simply states ("File saved.").

### Key Insight

Each dimension is a spectrum, not a binary. A brand positions itself on each slider, and the position can shift by context (e.g., error messages vs. onboarding). This framework is widely adopted in UX writing as the standard model for defining product tone.

## 2. Mailchimp Content Style Guide -- Voice and Tone Model

**Originator:** Mailchimp (originally developed by Kate Kiefer Lee and team)
**Source:** [Voice and Tone | Mailchimp Content Style Guide](https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/voice-and-tone/)

### The Framework

Mailchimp distinguishes **voice** (constant brand personality) from **tone** (variable emotional register that shifts with context). This distinction has become the foundational model used across the industry.

### Voice Attributes

Mailchimp defines its voice through character traits:
- **Offbeat humor:** Subtle over noisy, wry over farcical. Never forced.
- **Plainspoken:** Values clarity above all. Strips away hyperbole and over-promises.
- **Genuine:** Warm, accessible, relatable. Speaks to challenges honestly.

### Tone Variation by Context

Tone shifts based on the user's emotional state and the communication context:
- Writing to someone who just failed a campaign: empathetic, helpful, not jokey
- Writing onboarding content: encouraging, energetic, slightly playful
- Writing legal/compliance content: straightforward, no humor

### Writing Principles

- Use active voice; avoid passive voice
- Write in plain English; avoid slang and jargon
- Use positive language rather than negative language
- Clarity always trumps entertainment

### Key Insight

The Mailchimp guide (open-sourced on GitHub) became the template that hundreds of companies used to build their own content style guides. Its core innovation was mapping tone to user emotional states rather than treating it as a fixed property.

## 3. The 12 Brand Archetypes Framework

**Originator:** Based on Carl Jung's psychological archetypes; applied to branding by Margaret Mark and Carol S. Pearson in *The Hero and the Outlaw* (2001)
**Sources:**
- [Brand Archetypes: The Definitive Guide](https://iconicfox.com.au/brand-archetypes/)
- [The Ultimate Guide to the 12 Brand Archetypes | JD Meier](https://jdmeier.com/brand-archetypes/)

### The 12 Archetypes

| Archetype | Core Desire | Voice Characteristics | Example Brands |
|-----------|------------|----------------------|---------------|
| **The Innocent** | Safety, happiness | Optimistic, simple, honest, wholesome | Coca-Cola, Dove |
| **The Sage** | Truth, understanding | Wise, analytical, objective, informative | Google, BBC |
| **The Explorer** | Freedom, discovery | Adventurous, bold, independent, authentic | Patagonia, Jeep |
| **The Outlaw** | Liberation, revolution | Rebellious, disruptive, provocative, raw | Harley-Davidson, Virgin |
| **The Magician** | Transformation | Visionary, charismatic, imaginative, inspiring | Apple, Disney |
| **The Hero** | Mastery, courage | Bold, confident, determined, empowering | Nike, FedEx |
| **The Lover** | Intimacy, passion | Passionate, sensual, intimate, warm | Chanel, Victoria's Secret |
| **The Jester** | Joy, fun | Humorous, irreverent, playful, light | Old Spice, M&Ms |
| **The Everyman** | Belonging | Down-to-earth, friendly, humble, relatable | IKEA, Target |
| **The Caregiver** | Service, protection | Nurturing, warm, generous, supportive | Johnson & Johnson, TOMS |
| **The Ruler** | Control, authority | Commanding, refined, authoritative, premium | Mercedes-Benz, Rolex |
| **The Creator** | Innovation, vision | Inventive, expressive, artistic, nonconforming | Lego, Adobe |

### Key Insight

Each archetype implies a distinct writing voice. The framework maps personality to communication style, giving writers a character to "perform" rather than a set of abstract rules. Brands pick a primary and often a secondary archetype, then derive vocabulary, sentence structure, and rhetorical approach from that persona.

## 4. Margot Bloomstein -- Message Architecture

**Originator:** Margot Bloomstein, *Content Strategy at Work* (2012)
**Sources:**
- [Margot Bloomstein | Brand and Content Strategy](https://appropriateinc.com/)
- [Messaging Framework Tool: Keep It Simple](https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/articles/messaging-hierarchy-architecture-framework)

### The Framework

A **message architecture** is a hierarchy of communication goals -- a prioritized set of adjectives, terms, or statements that represent how an organization wants to be perceived. It is created through a collaborative card-sorting exercise with stakeholders.

### Process

1. Stakeholders sort ~100 adjective cards into three piles: "Who we are," "Who we are not," and "Who we'd like to be"
2. The "Who we are" and "Who we'd like to be" piles are discussed and ranked
3. The result is a prioritized vocabulary that drives all content decisions

### Key Insight

Unlike frameworks that define voice through personality traits, Bloomstein's approach generates voice from **organizational consensus on aspirational attributes**. The message architecture becomes the foundation for editorial decisions: every piece of content should move the brand toward its top-ranked attributes.

## 6. Content Design London -- Evidence-Based Content Framework

**Originator:** Sarah Richards (now Sarah Winters), developed at UK Government Digital Service (GDS) 2010-2014
**Sources:**
- [Content Design London](https://contentdesign.london/)
- [Content Design by Sarah Richards (book)](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/36124105)
- [Readability Guidelines](https://contentdesign.london/case-studies/readability-guidelines)

### The Framework

Content design treats content as a design problem. Instead of asking "what do we want to say?", it asks "what does the user need?"

### Core Principles

1. **Evidence-based:** Use data and user research to determine what content to create, not assumptions
2. **User needs first:** Content serves user needs, not organizational desires
3. **Format-agnostic:** The right answer might not be text -- it could be a video, infographic, calculator, or form
4. **Pair writing:** Write with the subject matter expert sitting beside you, combining their domain knowledge with the writer's communication skills
5. **Readability:** Design for the hardest conditions (stress, low literacy, cognitive impairment, non-fluency, mobile)

### Content Strategy Framework Components

- **Core:** The aspiration of all communications
- **Governance:** Who is responsible and accountable for content
- **Workflow:** How content gets from inception to publication and iteration
- **Substance:** The crux of what is being communicated

### Key Insight

CDL doesn't prescribe style categories in the traditional sense. Instead, it provides a methodology for arriving at the right style for each context through user research and evidence. The framework is process-oriented rather than taxonomy-oriented.

## 7. GatherContent -- Voice and Tone Matrix

**Originator:** GatherContent (content operations platform)
**Sources:**
- [5 tone of voice examples and tips](https://gathercontent.com/blog/a-simple-tool-to-guide-tone-of-voice)
- [Style, tone and voice: The whys, wheres and hows](https://gathercontent.com/blog/voice-tone-style-whys-wheres-hows)

### The Framework

GatherContent uses a **voice table** approach: 3-6 voice traits, each defined with "do this / don't do this" examples.

### Structure

| Voice Trait | Description | Do This | Don't Do This |
|------------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| e.g., Friendly | Warm, approachable | "We're here to help" | "Users must submit a request" |
| e.g., Confident | Assured, expert | "Here's what works" | "We think this might help" |
| e.g., Clear | Simple, direct | "Sign up free" | "Commence your complimentary registration" |

### Context-Specific Tone

Voice traits can be weighted differently by context:
- Help/Support: more "matter-of-fact"
- Research content: more "insightful"
- Social media: more "friendly"

### Key Insight

The do/don't example format is the most practically useful element. Abstract voice traits become actionable when paired with concrete examples of what they look like in actual content.

## 8. Meta (Facebook) -- Tone Mapping for Product Design

**Originator:** Susan Gray Blue, Content Strategy at Meta
**Source:** [A Content Strategist's Guide to Using Tone in Products](https://medium.com/facebook-design/a-content-strategists-guide-to-using-tone-in-products-bae168b6534c)

### The Framework

Meta maps tone to **user emotional states** across different product contexts. For any given message, the team considers:

1. **Context:** What is the user doing? (e.g., logging in on their birthday, encountering an error)
2. **Emotional state:** How is the user likely feeling? (festive, frustrated, confused, relieved)
3. **Tone response:** How should the product's tone meet that emotion?

### Tone Exercise

Write a single message (e.g., a welcome message or error) across a range of emotional registers:
- Sympathetic
- Celebratory
- Neutral/informative
- Urgent

This forces writers to develop range and discover that different product moments call for different tone positions even within the same brand voice.

### Key Insight

This framework is notable for being **product-moment-specific** rather than brand-level. It acknowledges that within a single product, tone must shift dramatically based on what the user is experiencing at that exact moment.

## 9. Torrey Podmajersky -- Voice Chart (Strategic Writing for UX)

**Originator:** Torrey Podmajersky, *Strategic Writing for UX* (O'Reilly, 2019; 2nd ed. updated for AI)
**Source:** [Strategic Writing for UX - O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/strategic-writing-for/9781492049388/)

### The Framework

The **Voice Chart** translates product principles into concrete writing guidelines across five dimensions:

| Dimension | What It Governs |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Concepts** | The ideas and themes derived from product principles |
| **Vocabulary** | Specific words and terms that embody the brand personality |
| **Verbosity** | How much information to include; brevity vs. thoroughness |
| **Grammar** | Sentence complexity, active/passive, contractions |
| **Punctuation & Capitalization** | Exclamation marks, ellipses, title case vs. sentence case |

### Key Insight

This is one of the most granular frameworks for product writing, moving beyond abstract personality traits to specify exactly how voice manifests at the word, sentence, and punctuation level. It bridges the gap between "we want to sound friendly" and "here's exactly how friendly looks in our UI strings."

## 10. Diataxis -- Documentation Style Framework

**Originator:** Daniele Procida
**Source:** [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/)

### The Framework

Diataxis organizes technical documentation into four types based on two axes: **learning vs. working** and **practical vs. theoretical**.

|  | Practical | Theoretical |
|--|-----------|-------------|
| **Learning** | Tutorial | Explanation |
| **Working** | How-to Guide | Reference |

### The Four Types

| Type | Purpose | Style Characteristics |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| **Tutorial** | Learning-oriented lesson | Guided, step-by-step, encouraging. "Follow me." Second person. Concrete examples. |
| **How-to Guide** | Goal-oriented recipe | Direct, procedural, action-focused. Assumes competence. Numbered steps. |
| **Reference** | Information-oriented description | Austere, factual, consistent structure. Comprehensive. No narrative. |
| **Explanation** | Understanding-oriented discussion | Discursive, contextual, considers alternatives. Can include opinion and history. |

### Key Insight

Diataxis is not a voice/tone framework but a **documentation style** framework. Each type demands a fundamentally different writing approach. The common mistake it corrects is mixing these modes (e.g., explaining concepts in the middle of a how-to guide), which confuses users. Each type has its own appropriate style.

## 11. Major Technical Writing Style Guides

### Google Developer Documentation Style Guide

**Source:** [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style)

- **Tone:** Conversational but informative. Friendly without being frivolous.
- **Person:** Second person ("you") for instructions.
- **Voice:** Active voice preferred.
- **Key principles:** Be concise. Be consistent. Be inclusive. Avoid jargon unless defining it.
- Originally internal (2005), made public 2017.

### Microsoft Writing Style Guide

**Source:** [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/)

- **Voice characteristics:** Warm and relaxed. Crisp and clear. Ready to lend a hand.
- **Top principles:** Use bigger ideas, fewer words. Write like you speak. Project friendliness with the second person. Get to the point fast. Be brief.
- Replaces the older *Microsoft Manual of Style* (4 editions, 1995-2012).

### Apple Style Guide

**Source:** [Apple Style Guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/applestyleguide/welcome/web)

- **Focus:** Precision in technical terminology. Inclusive language.
- **Tone:** Clear, direct, respectful. Less conversational than Google/Microsoft.
- **Key emphasis:** Put readers first. Use consistent terminology. Write accessibly.
- Available as a free Apple Books download.

### Key Insight

These three guides represent the industry standard for technical documentation style. They converge on: second person, active voice, plain language, inclusive terminology, and a helpful but not overly casual tone. Where they differ is in personality -- Microsoft is the warmest, Google is the most conversational, Apple is the most precise.

## 12. Product Voice Guides: Slack, Shopify, Stripe

### Slack

**Source:** [Voice and tone: communicating for clarity | Slack](https://api.slack.com/best-practices/voice-and-tone)

- **Voice:** Clear, concise, human. Confident and direct.
- **Principles:** Clarity over cleverness. No jargon. No fluff.
- **Tone:** Conversational -- "like chatting with a buddy" -- but never at the expense of usefulness.
- **Test:** Read work out loud. If it sounds weird, rewrite it.

### Shopify (Polaris)

**Source:** [Voice and tone | Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/voice-and-tone)

- **Voice:** Approachable but professional. Friendly, not playful.
- **Key rules:** "Great" is okay; "awesome!" is not. Avoid hyperbole and exclamation marks.
- **Tone variation:** Error messages are not written like onboarding. Tone adapts to merchant emotional state.
- Small moments of delight are acceptable; helping merchants get jobs done comes first.

### Stripe

- Known for extremely clear, precise technical documentation.
- Developer-first voice: assumes competence, respects the reader's time.
- Minimal personality -- lets clarity and accuracy be the brand.

### Key Insight

These product guides show a spectrum from personality-forward (Slack) to precision-forward (Stripe), with Shopify in the middle. All prioritize clarity and helpfulness, but they make different tradeoffs between warmth/personality and technical precision.

## Cross-Framework Synthesis

### Common Patterns Across All Frameworks

1. **Voice vs. Tone distinction** is universal: voice is constant personality; tone varies by context
2. **Clarity always wins** -- every framework prioritizes clear communication over stylistic flourish
3. **User/reader emotional state** matters -- the best frameworks map tone to what the audience is feeling
4. **Concrete examples** are more useful than abstract descriptions of style
5. **Spectrums over binaries** -- most frameworks use sliding scales, not categories

### Framework Selection by Use Case

| Use Case | Best Framework(s) |
|----------|-------------------|
| Defining brand personality | Brand Archetypes, Message Architecture |
| Setting product UI tone | NN/g Four Dimensions, Voice Chart (Podmajersky) |
| Creating content style guide | Mailchimp model, GatherContent voice table |
| Technical documentation | Diataxis, Google/Microsoft/Apple guides |
| Journalism / editorial | Journalism genre categories |
| Content design process | Content Design London, Meta Tone Mapping |
| Mapping tone to context | Meta Tone Map, Mailchimp context-based tone |
