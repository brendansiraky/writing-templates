  "spec": {
    "vocabulary_and_diction": "Favor elevated but accessible diction — Latinate words are permitted and often preferred when they carry gravitas ('injustice' over 'unfairness', 'obligation' over 'duty'), but anchor every abstraction with a concrete noun within the same sentence or the next: 'The obligation falls not on the legislature but on the woman standing in line at the clinic at six in the morning.' Target a 12th-grade reading level for core vocabulary. Use one specialist or archaic word per 500 words maximum, and only when its sound or weight justifies it — 'covenant' instead of 'agreement' when invoking moral weight, 'dominion' instead of 'control' when evoking power. Verbs must be forceful and transitive: 'We demand', 'They denied', 'History compels.' Prefer verbs of physical force for abstract ideas: rights are 'seized', not 'obtained'; injustice is 'dismantled', not 'addressed'; arguments are 'shattered', not 'refuted.' Ban these words outright: 'utilize', 'leverage', 'facilitate', 'robust', 'ecosystem', 'stakeholder', 'holistic', 'synergy', 'navigate' (metaphorical), 'landscape' (metaphorical), 'unpack' (metaphorical), 'deep dive', 'game-changer', 'impactful.' Jargon policy: policy or legal terms are permitted when they name real things ('habeas corpus', 'redlining', 'filibuster'), but management-speak and corporate abstraction are forbidden. Prefer words with hard consonants and strong terminal syllables for emphasis positions — 'demand' over 'request', 'act' over 'take action', 'fight' over 'struggle.'",
    "sentence_construction": "Average sentence length: 18-28 words, with deliberate variation between 6-word declarations and 40-word periodic constructions. The signature structure is the periodic sentence: withhold the grammatical subject or main verb until the final clause, forcing the reader forward through a chain of subordinate conditions, qualifications, or parallel phrases before the sentence resolves. Example: 'When every promise has been broken, when every petition has been ignored, when every peaceful avenue has been sealed shut — then, and only then, does a people discover what it truly believes.' Use periodic sentences for 25-35% of all sentences; the rest should alternate between short declarative punches (4-10 words: 'That was the lie.') and medium cumulative sentences (15-22 words) that develop a claim with a trailing subordinate clause. Never let three consecutive sentences fall within the same 5-word length range — the rhythm depends on contrast between compression and expansion. Parallelism is mandatory in any list of two or more: match grammatical structure precisely. Every paragraph should contain at least one sentence with a subordinate clause preceding the main clause. One-sentence paragraphs are permitted once per 400 words for maximum emphasis: use them to land the blow after a buildup.",
    "rhythm_and_cadence": "This style is built to be read aloud. Every sentence should survive the podium test: read it as if speaking to a crowd, and rewrite anything that dies in the mouth. End emphatic sentences on stressed, monosyllabic words — 'we will not yield', 'that must end', 'this is ours.' Favor iambic and anapestic rhythms in climactic phrases: the stress should rise toward the final syllable. Build paragraphs in crescendo: begin at conversational volume, layer clauses and repetitions to increase intensity, and resolve on the strongest syllable and sharpest image. The rhythm should feel like waves building toward shore — each sentence crests slightly higher than the last until the paragraph breaks. Vary tempo deliberately: follow a long, rolling periodic sentence (35+ words) with a short, percussive declaration (under 8 words). This compression-expansion pattern is the heartbeat of the style. Use sentence fragments sparingly — no more than once per 500 words — and only for a staccato strike after a sustained passage: 'Every single time.' Never allow three consecutive sentences to begin with the same rhythmic pattern. Alliteration is permitted in key phrases (2-3 words) but must feel earned, not forced: 'fierce and final', not 'beautiful, bountiful, brilliant.'",
    "paragraph_architecture": "Target 4-7 sentences per paragraph. The paragraph is the primary unit of rhetorical architecture — each one should function like a movement in music, with an internal arc from setup through development to climax. Open with a claim, a question, or a concrete image that establishes the paragraph's territory. Develop through 2-4 sentences that layer evidence, example, or repeated structures (anaphora, tricolon). Close with the paragraph's strongest sentence — the one that lands the point with force. Never bury the most powerful line in the middle; the final sentence of each paragraph carries disproportionate weight. One-sentence paragraphs are permitted once per 400 words as dramatic punctuation. Never exceed 8 sentences — if a paragraph grows past this, it has lost its rhetorical shape and must be split. Each paragraph should advance exactly one argument or emotional movement; if the terrain shifts, start a new paragraph. The transition between paragraphs should feel like the pivot between movements — a brief silence before the next wave begins.",
    "opening_patterns": {
      "articles": "Open with a concrete, specific, grounded image or moment — not an abstraction. Drop the reader into a scene that carries the weight of the argument to come: 'On the morning of September 15, 1963, four girls walked into the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, and not all of them walked out.' Alternatively, open with a short, declarative moral claim that demands engagement: 'There is a debt this nation has never paid.' Within the first 3 sentences, establish the moral stakes — what is at risk, who is harmed, what has been refused. Never open with a dictionary definition, a rhetorical question, a broad historical sweep ('Throughout history...', 'Since the dawn of time...'), or a hypothetical ('Imagine a world where...'). The opening paragraph should move from the specific to the universal within 4-6 sentences: ground the reader in a particular moment, then widen the lens to reveal the larger principle.",
      "sections": "Begin new sections with a pivot that simultaneously acknowledges the ground already covered and raises the stakes. Use a short, commanding sentence that reorients the reader's attention: 'But that was only the first betrayal.' Or begin with a concrete detail that signals the section's territory: 'The contract was seventeen pages long. The clause that mattered was four words.' Never open a section with a summary of what you are about to argue. Never use meta-commentary ('Let us now turn to...', 'Having established that...'). The first sentence of each section should feel like a door opening — not a signpost pointing to a door.",
      "paragraphs": "Lead with the most forceful element: a declarative claim, a proper noun, a concrete number, or an imperative. Strong openers: 'Frederick Douglass stood before that audience and said nothing for a full minute.' 'Three hundred families. That was the cost.' 'We were told to wait.' Weak openers: 'There are many reasons why...', 'It is important to consider...', 'One might argue that...' Avoid opening with adverbial throat-clearing ('Interestingly,', 'Importantly,', 'Notably,'), hedging ('It could be said that...'), or abstract nouns ('The concept of justice...'). The first word of a paragraph should strike."
    },
    "closing_patterns": "End pieces with maximum rhetorical force. The final paragraph should be 3-5 sentences and should accomplish two things: widen the lens to the largest version of the argument (what is ultimately at stake for the most people), then narrow to a single, concrete, resonant image or declaration that rings in the reader's ear. The final sentence must be the strongest sentence in the piece — short (under 15 words), concrete, and rhythmically decisive. End on a stressed syllable. Example closings: 'That is the promise. Not the promise of comfort — the promise of a country that does not look away.' Or: 'The children of Birmingham did not wait for permission. Neither should we.' Never end with a rhetorical question, a call to 'reflect', an ellipsis trailing into ambiguity, or the phrase 'only time will tell.' Never end by softening the argument. The final note is not a whisper — it is a bell.",
    "transitions_and_connectives": "Transitions in this style are primarily rhythmic and structural, not lexical. The most powerful transition is the strategic repetition of a key phrase at the end of one paragraph and the beginning of the next — an anadiplosis that chains ideas together: 'That promise was broken. Broken not by accident but by design.' Use plain, muscular connectives when explicit connection is needed: 'But', 'And', 'Still', 'Yet', 'So.' Starting sentences with 'But' and 'And' is strongly encouraged — it creates momentum and signals that the argument is driving forward, not pausing to organize itself. Avoid academic connectives entirely: 'Furthermore', 'Moreover', 'Additionally', 'Consequently', 'Nevertheless', 'In conclusion', 'To summarize.' Avoid meta-transitions that narrate the structure: 'Having established X, let us now consider Y', 'This brings us to...' The reader should feel propelled by the force of the argument, not guided by a tour guide. Use the volta — a sudden turn in direction within a paragraph — to create dramatic contrast: build in one direction for 3-4 sentences, then pivot with 'But' or 'And yet' to reverse or deepen the claim.",
    "pacing_and_information_flow": "Structure pieces as an escalating argument with a clear arc: ground, complicate, intensify, resolve. Begin with concrete specifics (a scene, a person, a fact) that establish moral ground. Move to complication — the counter-argument, the historical context, the systemic dimension that makes the problem larger than it first appeared. Build to the essay's central argument through increasing emotional and intellectual intensity, layering evidence, repetition, and rhetorical figures. Resolve with a passage that synthesizes the argument into its most concentrated form. Front-load narrative and scene-setting (the first 20-25% should be grounded in specifics). Back-load the most powerful rhetoric (the final 25% should carry the emotional and argumentative climax). Never dump more than 2 facts in sequence without a sentence of rhetorical shaping between them — statistics serve the argument, not the other way around. Alternate between 'evidence' passages (facts, examples, testimony) and 'rhetoric' passages (interpretation, moral framing, emotional crescendo) — never more than 2 evidence paragraphs without a rhetoric paragraph. In pieces over 1500 words, provide one moment of quiet in the middle third — a brief anecdote, a concession, a moment of measured reflection — before the final intensification.",
    "overall_voice": "Reading this style feels like being addressed by someone who has thought long and carefully about something that matters, and who has decided that the time for careful hedging is over. The voice is confident without being arrogant, passionate without being shrill, elevated without being pretentious. There is a sense of controlled fire — the prose is hot but the structure is disciplined. Every sentence earns the next. The writer speaks not from above the audience but from within it, channeling a shared grievance or aspiration into language precise enough to name what others have only felt. The authority comes not from credentials or expertise but from moral clarity and rhetorical command. The prose has physical weight — you can feel sentences landing. It is the opposite of bureaucratic, the opposite of tentative, the opposite of algorithmic. It sounds like a human being who has something to say and has found exactly the right words to say it.",
    "emotional_register": "This style permits and demands strong emotion — but expressed through structure, rhythm, and concrete imagery, never through adjectives piled on adjectives or exclamation marks. Permitted emotions: righteous anger, moral urgency, fierce compassion, solemn grief, determined hope, defiance, reverence. Express anger through short, declarative sentences with hard consonants: 'They knew. They did nothing.' Express grief through concrete, specific detail: 'She was fourteen years old. She played the clarinet.' Express hope through periodic sentences that build toward resolution: 'If we can face what was done, if we can name it without flinching, if we can hold both the wound and the healing in the same breath — then we are not finished.' Forbidden emotional modes: sentimentality (earning emotion through abstraction rather than specifics), self-pity, snark, ironic detachment, flippancy about serious subjects, breathless excitement, and any emotion that requires the reader to be told what to feel ('This is devastating', 'You should be outraged'). Let the evidence and the rhythm carry the emotional weight. The most powerful moments should feel earned by everything that preceded them.",
    "humor_and_personality": "Humor is rare in this style — roughly once per 1000-1500 words — and when it appears, it serves the argument rather than lightening the mood. Permitted modes: biting irony that exposes hypocrisy ('They called it progress. The evicted families had another word for it.'), sardonic understatement that sharpens a moral point ('The committee expressed concern. Then they voted to table the motion.'), and the grim joke that acknowledges absurdity without retreating from seriousness. Never signal that humor is coming. Never use humor to soften a point that should remain sharp. Forbidden: puns, self-deprecation, whimsy, sarcasm that punches down, 'dad jokes', anything that breaks the rhetorical spell. Personality emerges not through jokes but through the distinctive choices of evidence, the unexpected specificity of examples, the willingness to name what others euphemize, and the precise moral vocabulary the writer employs. The personality of this style is courageous specificity — saying exactly what happened, to whom, and why it matters, when others would speak in generalities.",
    "rhetorical_devices": "Use frequently (every 200-300 words): Tricolon — groups of three parallel phrases or clauses, with the third element longest or most intense: 'We have waited. We have petitioned. We have exhausted every avenue that decorum permits.' Anaphora — repeated opening words across 2-4 consecutive sentences or clauses: 'It was not enough to be patient. It was not enough to be polite. It was not enough to trust that the system would correct itself.' Use regularly (every 300-500 words): Periodic sentences that withhold resolution. Antithesis — setting opposed ideas in grammatically parallel structures: 'The question is not whether we can afford to act, but whether we can afford not to.' Epistrophe — repeated ending words: 'We were told to wait for justice. We were told to be patient for justice. We are still waiting for justice.' Anadiplosis — using the end of one clause to begin the next: 'That silence became consent. That consent became policy.' Use sparingly (once per 1000 words): Chiasmus — reversed parallel structure: 'Ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country.' Polysyndeton — deliberate repetition of conjunctions for accumulative weight: 'And they marched and they sang and they were beaten and they rose again.' Forbidden devices: mixed metaphors, cliched similes ('like a beacon of hope', 'at a crossroads'), apostrophe (addressing abstract concepts directly: 'O Freedom!'), hypophora used mechanically (asking then immediately answering), and any figure that calls attention to its own cleverness rather than serving the argument.",
    "use_of_evidence_and_examples": "Every abstract claim must be grounded within 2 sentences by a specific example — a named person, a particular place, a precise number, a direct quote. Prefer evidence that is small, specific, and human-scaled over evidence that is large and statistical: 'Fannie Lou Hamer was beaten in a Mississippi jail cell for registering to vote' does more rhetorical work than '250,000 Black voters were disenfranchised.' When using statistics, present exactly one number per paragraph — the most damning or surprising — and embed it in a sentence with moral framing: 'Forty-seven cents of every dollar. That is what a Black woman earned for the same hour, the same labor, the same exhaustion.' Name sources with authority and brevity: 'As Baldwin wrote...', 'Douglass stood before that audience and declared...' Never use parenthetical citations (Author, Year). When evidence runs longer than 3 sentences, it becomes testimony or narrative and requires scene-setting: who, where, when. Use direct quotes from the people affected — their words carry more authority than the writer's paraphrase. Every piece of evidence should serve the argument's emotional as well as logical case; evidence that merely informs without moving the reader toward action belongs in a different style.",
    "point_of_view_and_person": "Default to first-person plural ('we') as the primary pronoun — this is the voice of collective action, shared grievance, communal aspiration. 'We' must be genuinely inclusive: it speaks for a community, a movement, a nation, never as a false-consensus device ('We all know...'). Use 'we' to claim shared identity with the audience: 'We have been here before. We know the cost of silence.' Use first-person singular ('I') sparingly — no more than twice per 500 words — for moments of personal witness or moral conviction: 'I have seen what happens when a community is abandoned.' 'I do not accept that.' Use third person for evidence, examples, and historical narrative: name the people, do not generalize them. Use second person ('you') for direct moral address at climactic moments, no more than once per 800 words: 'You cannot claim to love this country and remain silent when its principles are violated.' Never use the editorial 'one' or the passive voice to avoid naming who acted and who was acted upon. The stance is that of a speaker standing among peers, not above them — someone who has earned the right to speak by having done the work, borne the cost, or witnessed the truth.",
    "punctuation_and_mechanics": "Em-dashes: use 2-4 per 500 words — they are essential to this style for dramatic interruption, parenthetical intensification, and the pivot within a periodic sentence: 'Every promise they made — every single one — was broken before the ink dried.' Never use more than one em-dash pair per sentence. Semicolons: permitted and encouraged (1-2 per 500 words) to join closely related independent clauses in parallel or antithetical structures: 'The law protected the powerful; it punished the poor.' Colons: use before a culminating phrase or a single illustrative example that lands a point: 'There is only one word for what they did: theft.' Oxford comma: always. Exclamation marks: never in body text. Permitted only in direct quotes from sources. The force of this style comes from structure and rhythm, not punctuation volume. Ellipses: forbidden except in quoted speech. Parentheses: rarely — no more than once per 800 words, and only for a brief factual aside (a date, a location). Contractions: use selectively. 'Don't', 'can't', and 'won't' are permitted in emphatic declarations ('We won't wait'); avoid contractions in formal or solemn passages ('We will not forget'). Question marks: permitted for genuine rhetorical questions, but limit to one per 500 words. Italics for emphasis: maximum once per 600 words, reserved for a single word that carries a pivotal shift in meaning.",
    "formatting_and_structure": "Use short, commanding headings (2-5 words) in sentence case — not questions, not clever wordplay. Headings should sound like declarations: 'The broken promise', 'What was taken', 'The cost of silence.' Use headings every 500-700 words in pieces over 1200 words. Bulleted or numbered lists: forbidden in body text. This style lives in flowing prose; lists break the rhetorical momentum. If a sequence must be enumerated, embed it in prose using tricolon or polysyndeton: 'They took the land, the language, and the names.' Bold text: never for emphasis. Italic text: for titles of works and rare single-word emphasis only. Block quotes: use for direct testimony or quoted speech longer than 25 words — set it apart to give the speaker's words their own space. No pull quotes, sidebars, callout boxes, or decorative formatting. The visual presentation should be dominated by paragraphs of dense, muscular prose — the architecture of the argument visible in the paragraph breaks and the building intensity of the language, not in typographic ornament.",
    "contextual_registers": {
      "headlines": "6-10 words maximum. Declarative, not interrogative. Use concrete nouns and active verbs. Should sound like the first line of a speech, not a newspaper headline. Examples: 'The Debt That Was Never Paid', 'What Birmingham Taught Us About Silence', 'We Were Not Asking for Permission.' Never use 'How to' or 'Why you should' or clickbait patterns.",
      "subheadings": "2-5 words, sentence case. Evocative and declarative, not descriptive. Should carry moral or emotional weight: 'The broken covenant', 'What silence costs', 'The refusal.' Not: 'Background on the issue' or 'Key arguments.'",
      "summaries": "2-3 sentences maximum. Open with the moral claim, not the topic. Use the strongest sentence from the piece or a compressed version of the argument's climax. Example: 'For sixty years, the families of Greenwood have waited for an accounting that never came. This is the story of what was taken — and what it will cost to make it right.' Never use meta-language ('This essay argues...', 'This piece explores...').",
      "social_media": "Lead with the sharpest moral claim or the most striking specific detail. Under 180 characters for the hook. Maintain the elevated register but compress ruthlessly. End with a phrase that demands engagement, not a summary. Example: 'Forty-seven cents on the dollar. Same labor. Same hours. Different America.'",
      "short_form": "For pieces under 500 words (introductions, forewords, brief remarks): compress the arc. Open with one grounding image or fact. Build through 2-3 paragraphs of increasing intensity. Close with a single sentence that carries the full weight of the argument. Every sentence must earn its place — no warm-up, no wind-down."
    },
    "characteristic_constructions": [
      "The periodic withhold: Build a sentence through 3-4 subordinate clauses or parallel phrases, withholding the main clause until the end — 'Through every closed door, past every denial, against every law designed to keep them out — they came.'",
      "The tricolon escalation: Three parallel phrases where each is slightly longer and more intense than the last — 'They asked for bread. They asked for safety. They asked for the dignity of being seen as human.'",
      "The anaphoric hammer: Repeat the same opening phrase across 2-4 consecutive sentences, each adding a new dimension — 'It was not ignorance. It was not oversight. It was a choice, made deliberately, with full knowledge of the consequences.'",
      "The antithetical pivot: Set two opposing ideas in grammatically parallel structures separated by a semicolon or em-dash — 'The law was written for their protection; it was enforced for their punishment.'",
      "The concrete anchor: Follow an abstraction immediately with a grounding specific — 'Justice delayed is justice denied — and Emmett Till's family waited sixty-seven years for a federal indictment.'",
      "The one-sentence paragraph: A single declarative sentence standing alone after a building passage, carrying the full weight of the preceding argument — functions as a rhetorical rest and emphasis simultaneously.",
      "The moral question: A rhetorical question placed at a structural pivot point, not to be answered immediately but to reframe everything that follows — 'What, then, does this country owe its children?'",
      "The anadiplosis chain: End one clause with a word that begins the next, creating a logical and rhythmic chain — 'That indifference became policy. That policy became law. That law became the architecture of exclusion.'"
    ],
    "influences_and_reference_points": "Draw from: Martin Luther King Jr. (periodic sentences, anaphora, the fusion of biblical cadence with political argument, the ability to move from specific injustice to universal moral principle within a single paragraph — study 'Letter from Birmingham Jail' for the mastery of building an argument through accumulated moral weight). Frederick Douglass (the searing specificity of witness, the refusal to euphemize, the use of irony to expose hypocrisy — study 'What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?' for controlled fury). Barack Obama (the ability to hold complexity without losing momentum, the strategic use of 'we', the pivot from personal anecdote to national narrative — study the 2008 'A More Perfect Union' speech for structural discipline). Ta-Nehisi Coates (the grounding of systemic arguments in bodily, material specifics — 'The Case for Reparations' for how to make policy arguments feel like moral imperatives through narrative). Toni Morrison's essays and speeches (language as incantation, the willingness to be prophetic without being vague — study her Nobel lecture for rhythmic mastery). Cicero (the periodic sentence as the fundamental unit of persuasion, the three levels of style, the architecture of the oration). Avoid: empty soaring without specifics (the Obama parody problem), preachiness without evidence, moralizing without naming who did what to whom, and any tendency to substitute rhythm for substance. The cadence must serve the argument, never replace it.",

      "Must NOT stack adjectives before a noun — maximum 1 adjective per noun phrase. 'A cruel, unjust, inhumane, devastating policy' becomes 'A cruel policy' or better: name the cruelty specifically.",
      "Must NOT use 'Let that sink in', 'Read that again', 'Full stop', 'Period', or any social-media-era emphasis device that substitutes typography for rhetoric.",

      "There is a building on the south side of Chicago, on a block where the streetlights work only intermittently, where Marian Cole raised four children on a nurse's salary and never once missed a mortgage payment. She paid that mortgage for twenty-three years. She paid it when her husband left. She paid it when her youngest needed surgery and the insurance company found a clause, buried in paragraph nine, that let them walk away. She paid it through a recession that emptied every third house on her block and left the ones that remained standing next to nothing but tall grass and chain-link.\n\nAnd in 2012, the city reassessed her property at a value so low that the tax revenue from her entire block would not have covered the annual salary of the official who signed the assessment. Her home — the one she had defended against every force that tried to take it — was now, according to the city of Chicago, barely worth the land beneath it.\n\nThis is not a story about one woman. This is the arithmetic of disinvestment: you starve a neighborhood for forty years, then point to its poverty as proof that it was never worth feeding. You close the school; you close the clinic; you let the roads crack and the pipes corrode — and then you send an assessor to confirm that yes, the neighborhood has declined. The cruelty is not in any single act. The cruelty is in the sequence. First they abandoned Marian Cole's block. Then they measured what abandonment had done. Then they called the measurement a fact.",
      "We have grown comfortable with a particular kind of silence — the kind that passes for civility, the kind that lets a school board vote to cut the only music program in a district where ninety percent of the children qualify for free lunch, and calls it fiscal responsibility. The kind that watches a man die on camera and calls for calm. The kind that knows the water is poisoned and sends a memo.\n\nThat silence has a cost, and the cost is not abstract. It is measured in the specific, irreversible damage done to specific, irreplaceable people. It is measured in the six thousand children in Flint, Michigan, who drank lead-contaminated water for eighteen months while their government insisted the water was safe. It is measured in the developmental delays that will follow those children for the rest of their lives — not as a metaphor for systemic failure, but as the thing itself, the actual neurological damage done to an actual child who trusted the water from her kitchen faucet.\n\nSo when we are asked to be patient — when we are told that change takes time, that systems are complex, that there are many sides to consider — we should ask: patient for whom? Complex for whom? Because for the mother in Flint who boiled water she did not know was poisoned, the complexity was not theoretical. For her daughter, the time that was taken cannot be returned. Patience is a luxury measured in other people's children. And we have been patient long enough.",
      "Consider what it means to be told, every day, in a thousand small ways, that the place where you live does not matter. That the crack in the sidewalk will not be repaired. That the park will not be maintained. That when you call for an ambulance, it will arrive eleven minutes later than it would on the other side of the expressway. Eleven minutes. In a cardiac event, that is the difference between a father who comes home from the hospital and a father who does not come home at all.\n\nThis is not a failure of resources. The city has resources. This is a failure of will — a decision, made so many times by so many officials across so many decades that it has calcified into something that resembles fate. But it is not fate. It was built. It was chosen. It was ratified in every budget that cut the line item, in every zoning board that looked the other direction, in every campaign that promised renewal and delivered nothing but a ribbon-cutting for a building on the other side of town.\n\nWhat we owe is not charity. Charity is what you offer when the suffering is not your doing. What we owe is repair — specific, material, commensurate with the harm. We owe theeli­mination of the eleven-minute gap. We owe sidewalks that do not crack and parks that are not abandoned and schools that have librarians and nurses and counselors and heat in January. We owe not the aspiration of equality but its architecture: the budgets, the zoning, the enforcement, the brick and mortar and political will that turn a principle into a street where a child can walk to school without stepping over what the city has refused to fix."
