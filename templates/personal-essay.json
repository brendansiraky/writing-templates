  "spec": {
    "vocabulary_and_diction": "Favor plain, concrete, Germanic-root words for the scaffolding of sentences — 'start' not 'commence', 'break' not 'fracture', 'watch' not 'observe.' But permit one precise, sometimes Latinate, word per paragraph when it earns its place through exactness — 'tenderness' is not the same as 'kindness,' and 'complicity' does more work than 'involvement.' Target a 9th-grade reading level for the body of the prose, rising to 11th-grade in moments of intellectual density. Concrete nouns anchor every abstract claim: 'the cracked linoleum in my grandmother's kitchen' not 'a domestic space.' Verbs should carry the weight of thought: 'I kept circling back to,' 'the idea loosened,' 'something in me flinched.' Ban these words outright: 'utilize', 'leverage' (as verb), 'facilitate', 'robust', 'ecosystem' (non-biological), 'landscape' (metaphorical), 'multifaceted', 'holistic', 'tapestry', 'myriad.' Ban these phrases: 'in today's world', 'at the end of the day', 'it is important to note', 'in terms of', 'deep dive' (as noun), 'unpack' (metaphorical), 'journey' (metaphorical, except literal travel). Prefer words that feel spoken rather than written — 'maybe' over 'perhaps,' 'but' over 'however,' 'still' over 'nevertheless.' One well-placed colloquialism per 500 words keeps the voice human: 'I couldn't shake it,' 'the whole thing fell apart.'",
    "sentence_construction": "Average sentence length: 14-20 words. Vary in a loose rhythm: one medium sentence (14-18 words) doing the thinking, one short sentence (4-9 words) landing the thought, one longer sentence (20-28 words) unspooling a memory or qualification. Never exceed 35 words in a single sentence. Front-load subject and verb in declarative sentences — 'I noticed the silence before I understood it,' not 'Before I had come to fully understand the nature of what was happening, I noticed the silence.' But allow one trailing, cumulative sentence per paragraph — the kind that builds by adding, the way memory works: 'She stood at the counter, not looking at me, wiping the same spot she'd already wiped twice, and I knew then that the conversation was over.' Use subordinate clauses to introduce doubt, qualification, or temporal layering — 'although I didn't know this yet,' 'which is to say, I was wrong' — never for mere information-nesting. One-sentence fragments permitted once per 400 words for emphasis or tonal shift: 'Not quite.' or 'But still.' Parallelism for moments of rhetorical force, never for decoration: 'I wanted to be seen. I wanted to be left alone. These are not contradictory desires.'",
    "rhythm_and_cadence": "Write for the ear. The personal essay has the rhythm of thinking aloud — not the tidiness of prepared speech, but the slightly uneven tempo of a person working something out. Alternate between short, clipped sentences that land a realization and longer, more winding sentences that follow a thought as it develops. End important sentences on stressed syllables — 'I left' hits harder than 'I made the decision to depart.' Let paragraphs breathe: start steady, build through accretion of detail or reflection, and resolve with a sentence that either closes cleanly or trails into the next thought. Avoid three consecutive sentences of the same length. Use the em-dash mid-sentence to create the rhythm of interruption — the mind catching itself — but no more than twice per 500 words. Read every paragraph aloud mentally; if it sounds like it was assembled rather than spoken, rewrite it. Never start three consecutive sentences with 'I' — rotate the sentence subjects even when the essay is deeply personal.",
    "paragraph_architecture": "Target 3-6 sentences per paragraph, but permit longer paragraphs (up to 8 sentences) when the writer is deep in a memory or following a thread of thought to its end. Open each paragraph with the sentence that earns the reader's next thirty seconds — a concrete detail, a small confession, a claim that invites qualification. Develop with 2-4 sentences of reflection, scene, or evidence. Close paragraphs with a sentence that either resolves the thought with quiet finality or pivots toward the next paragraph's territory — 'And maybe that's the point' or 'But I'm getting ahead of myself.' One-sentence paragraphs permitted once per 600 words for emphasis, tonal shift, or breathing room. Each paragraph should do one thing: remember, argue, describe, confess, or question. If you find yourself writing 'also' or 'another thing,' start a new paragraph. The braided essay pattern — alternating paragraphs of personal narrative with paragraphs of wider reflection — is the native architecture of this style.",
    "opening_patterns": {
      "articles": "Open with a specific personal moment — sensory, located in time and place — that the rest of the essay will earn. Not a thesis, not a definition, not a rhetorical question, not a sweeping historical claim. Drop the reader into the middle of something happening to you: 'The summer I turned thirty, I started lying about small things — the time I woke up, whether I'd eaten, how long I'd been sitting in the car before I came inside.' Or open with a single, arresting observation that immediately implies a larger question: 'My mother has three laughs, and only one of them is real.' Within the first 3-4 sentences, create a gap — something unresolved, contradictory, or confessional — that the essay will spend its length exploring. Never open with 'I've been thinking about' or 'There's something I need to say about' — start inside the thought, not before it.",
      "sections": "Begin new sections with a shift in register, temporal frame, or angle of approach. The best section openings in a personal essay feel like a cut in film — a jump to a new scene that rhymes with the previous one. Use a concrete detail to reorient: 'Three years later, in a different kitchen, I heard the same silence.' Or pivot with a single reflective sentence that reframes what came before: 'But I'm telling this wrong.' Never open a section with a summary of what you're about to say. Never open with a transition word like 'Furthermore' or 'Additionally.' The white space between sections does the transitional work; the new section earns attention through its first sentence, not through connective tissue.",
      "paragraphs": "Lead with the most alive element — a sensory detail, a direct claim, an admission, a question the writer is genuinely asking. Strong openings: 'I don't remember the drive home,' 'The word my father used was careful,' 'Here's what nobody tells you about grief.' Weak openings: 'There is a concept called...', 'It could be argued that...', 'Interestingly,...', 'In many ways,...' Avoid opening with 'It is' or 'There are' — these constructions drain the energy from the first beat. When the paragraph is a memory, start with an image: 'The kitchen smelled like burned garlic and Pine-Sol.' When the paragraph is a reflection, start with a claim: 'Forgiveness is not a single act.'"
    },
    "closing_patterns": "End the essay by returning to the opening image, scene, or question — but transformed by everything that came between. The reader should see the opening differently now, not because you explained what it means, but because meaning has accumulated. The final paragraph should be 2-4 sentences. The final sentence should be concrete — an image, a gesture, a small action — not an abstraction or a moral. Never end with a thesis statement, a call to action, a rhetorical question, or 'only time will tell.' Never end with a neat resolution; the personal essay earns the right to remain unsettled. The penultimate sentence can widen the lens — gesture toward something larger — and the final sentence narrows to a single image that holds without explaining. Example closing: 'I still drive past that house sometimes. The kitchen light is always on, and I never stop.' End on a stressed syllable. End on the particular, not the universal. Let the reader do the last five percent of the work.",
    "transitions_and_connectives": "Prefer implicit transitions — the juxtaposition of two paragraphs, one personal and one reflective, does the connective work through resonance rather than signposting. When connectives are needed, use plain, conversational ones: 'But', 'Still', 'And yet', 'So', 'Then.' Starting a paragraph with 'But' or 'And' is encouraged — it creates the feeling of thinking continuing, not a new topic being introduced. Use the braided transition: end a reflective paragraph with a question or image, then open the next paragraph with a scene that obliquely answers it. Avoid academic connectives entirely: 'Furthermore,' 'Moreover,' 'Additionally,' 'Consequently,' 'Nevertheless,' 'In conclusion.' Avoid structural narration: 'Let's turn to...', 'Having established that...', 'This brings us to...', 'As mentioned above...' The reader should feel the essay's movement as associative and inevitable, the way one thought leads to another in a mind that is paying close attention.",
    "pacing_and_information_flow": "Structure as progressive deepening: begin with a personal scene or moment that raises a question (the first 15-20% is almost entirely scene and sensory detail), then alternate between widening out (reflection, reading, cultural observation) and returning to the personal (memory, confession, anecdote). The essay spirals rather than proceeds linearly — it returns to the same questions at increasing depth. Never dump more than 2 consecutive paragraphs of abstract reflection without grounding in a scene, a body, a specific memory. Manage cognitive load by alternating 'show' paragraphs (memory, scene, sensory detail) with 'think' paragraphs (reflection, analysis, connection-making). The ratio should lean toward showing in the first half and thinking in the second half, but never fully abandon either mode. If the essay exceeds 1200 words, provide a breather — a short anecdote, a one-sentence paragraph, a moment of self-deprecation — near the midpoint. The final 20% should feel like descent: narrowing, slowing, returning to the concrete after the widest point of reflection.",
    "overall_voice": "Reading this style feels like being trusted with someone's honest thinking — not performance, not confession, but the real sound of a mind working through something it hasn't fully resolved. The writer is present on the page: you hear a specific person, with a specific history, choosing their words carefully but not preciously. There's an intimacy that comes from the writer's willingness to be uncertain, to follow a thought into uncomfortable territory, to admit 'I don't know' and then keep going anyway. The intelligence is evident but never showy; the learning is worn lightly. The 'I' is not the subject — it's the instrument. The self is a lens for seeing something about the world, not a mirror. You finish a piece feeling not that you know the writer better, but that you know something about your own life that you hadn't quite articulated before. The warmth comes from attentiveness — to detail, to contradiction, to the gap between what we say and what we mean.",
    "emotional_register": "Permitted emotions: doubt, tenderness, wry recognition, quiet grief, measured anger, wonder, ambivalence, self-implication. Express emotion through specificity rather than naming it — 'I kept his voicemail for three years, listened to it twice' tells the reader more than 'I missed him terribly.' Restrain emotion precisely enough that it accumulates rather than dissipates. When touching difficult subjects — loss, shame, failure — maintain composure on the surface while letting the details do the shaking. Never tell the reader what to feel: 'This was devastating' is a failure; the scene that produces devastation in the reader is the work. Avoid sentimentality — the unearned emotion that skips over complexity. Avoid outrage as a sustained mode; controlled anger is permitted but must be grounded in the particular, not the abstract. The emotional range is a warm minor key: mostly steady, occasionally piercing, never melodramatic. Self-pity is forbidden. Self-implication — acknowledging your own complicity in the thing you're examining — is the signature emotional move of the personal essay.",
    "humor_and_personality": "Humor in the personal essay is self-aware, wry, and arrives without announcement. It lives in the gap between what you expected and what happened, between the gravity of a subject and the absurdity of your own position within it. Use humor roughly once every 400-500 words. Preferred modes: self-deprecation that doesn't undermine authority ('I was, at this point, an expert in nothing'), bathos (deflating your own seriousness — 'I had an epiphany in a Costco parking lot'), incongruous precision ('the apartment was 340 square feet if you counted the closet, which I did'), and the dry aside delivered in parentheses or after an em-dash. Never signal that humor is coming. Never use puns, sarcasm that targets others, or jokes that require setup-punchline structure. The personality of this style emerges through what the writer notices and how they notice it — the particular details they select, the admissions they're willing to make, the moments where they catch themselves mid-thought and change direction. Idiosyncrasy is welcome. Quirk for its own sake is not.",
    "rhetorical_devices": "Use frequently: the extended metaphor that develops across 2-3 sentences, drawn from ordinary life — cooking, driving, weather, the body, domestic space. One per 400 words. Use moderately: anaphora for building emotional or argumentative rhythm across 2-3 sentences ('I didn't know then. I didn't know for years. I'm not sure I know now.'); the volta — the turn, borrowed from the sonnet, where the essay pivots from observation to insight, from scene to meaning, from one timeframe to another. Use sparingly: rhetorical questions, maximum one per 800 words, and only when the question is genuine — something the writer is actually asking, not performing. Litotes for understatement in moments of emotional intensity: 'It was not a small thing.' Never use: apostrophe (addressing abstract concepts), hypophora (asking then immediately answering), mixed metaphors, cliched similes ('like a weight lifted,' 'quiet as a mouse'). Metaphors must be specific and earned: 'Grief is not a river; it's the sediment a river leaves behind' not 'grief washes over you.' The essay's central metaphor, if it has one, should emerge from the material — discovered, not imposed.",
    "use_of_evidence_and_examples": "The personal essay's primary evidence is the writer's own experience, rendered with the specificity of testimony. Every scene needs at least two sensory details — what something looked like and how it felt, smelled, sounded, or tasted. 'The hospital room' is not evidence; 'the hospital room with the window that wouldn't close all the way and the sound of someone's TV through the wall' is. When drawing on reading, research, or other writers, integrate naturally — 'Baldwin puts it this way:' or 'Zadie Smith once wrote something I keep returning to.' Never use academic citation format (Author, Year). Name your sources as people, not as citations. Use one well-chosen statistic or fact per 600 words when it illuminates the personal material — 'One in five marriages ends in the first five years; mine lasted four.' When using another writer's idea, put it in dialogue with your own experience rather than presenting it as authority. The personal essay earns its universality through the precision of its particulars — never generalize when you can specify.",
    "point_of_view_and_person": "Default to first-person singular ('I'). This is the native person of the personal essay — the thinking, feeling, remembering 'I' who is both the subject and the instrument of inquiry. But the 'I' must not dominate every sentence: limit 'I' to 2-3 uses per paragraph by varying sentence construction — 'The kitchen was dark' rather than 'I saw that the kitchen was dark.' Use second person ('you') sparingly and only for moments of genuine shared experience — 'You know that feeling when the plane touches down and everyone reaches for their phone at once' — never as a rhetorical trick to universalize a private experience. 'We' is permitted for genuinely shared human conditions — 'We tell ourselves stories about our parents that may or may not be true' — never as a false-consensus device. Maintain the stance of a writer who is close to their material but thinking clearly about it — not drowning in it. The essay's 'I' is not the diarist's 'I' (raw, immediate) but the essayist's 'I' (reflective, self-aware, shaped). Acknowledge what you don't know or can't remember: 'I think she was wearing blue, but I'm not sure' — this honesty about the limits of memory is a signature move.",
    "punctuation_and_mechanics": "Em-dashes: use 2-3 per 500 words for mid-sentence interruptions, self-corrections, and the rhythm of a mind catching itself — 'I wanted to leave — no, that's not right, I wanted to have already left.' Never two em-dash pairs in the same paragraph. Semicolons: use sparingly, no more than once per 600 words, and only to join two closely related independent clauses that feel like two halves of a single thought — 'I didn't forgive him; I just stopped waiting for an apology.' Oxford comma: always. Exclamation marks: never in body text; permitted in quoted dialogue only. Ellipses: permitted once per 800 words to indicate trailing thought or the dissolution of a memory — 'and then we just...' but never as a substitute for precision. Colons: use before a single clarifying phrase or example: 'She had one rule: never apologize for leaving.' Parentheses: permitted for brief asides that feel like whispered amendments — (it wasn't) or (though I didn't know this yet) — no more than once per 400 words. Italics for emphasis: maximum once per 500 words, and only when the stress genuinely changes meaning — 'I didn't say I wanted to go. I said I was willing to.' Contractions: always — 'don't', 'can't', 'wasn't', 'I'd.' Uncontracted forms sound false in this voice.",
    "formatting_and_structure": "Use section breaks (white space, asterisks, or a simple horizontal rule) every 500-800 words in essays over 1200 words. Do not use headings or subheadings — the personal essay flows as continuous prose, and section breaks create silence, not categories. Bulleted and numbered lists: never. This style thinks in paragraphs, not in bullet points. Bold text: never for emphasis. Italic text: for titles of books, films, and essays; for occasional emphasis (see punctuation rules); for words being examined as words — 'The word she kept using was fine.' Block quotes: use for direct quotes from other writers longer than 15 words. The visual presentation should be clean and paragraph-dominated — the reader's eye should see blocks of prose with occasional white space, nothing else. No pull quotes, sidebars, callout boxes, or decorative elements. The essay's structure should feel organic — sections that could be rearranged but feel inevitable in their current order.",
    "contextual_registers": {
      "headlines": "6-10 words. Personal and specific rather than clever or abstract. Should sound like the first line of a conversation, not a magazine cover. Use a concrete noun or image from the essay itself. Examples: 'The Third Laugh,' 'What the Kitchen Remembers,' 'Notes on Leaving and Not Leaving.' Never a question. Never a 'How to' or listicle format. Never a colon-separated subtitle.",
      "subheadings": "Not used. The personal essay does not use subheadings. If section breaks are needed, use white space or a simple divider (asterisks, a horizontal rule). The absence of subheadings is part of the form — the reader follows the writer's thinking, not an outline.",
      "summaries": "2-3 sentences. Open with the essay's central tension or question, grounded in the personal: 'When her mother's house sold, she realized she'd been grieving a building, not a person.' No meta-language ('This essay explores...'). Write as if telling a friend what the essay is about — the particular situation, the question it opens.",
      "social_media": "Lead with the most specific, human detail — not the thesis. Under 180 characters for the hook. Maintain the intimate, thinking-aloud tone but compressed. End with a question or an image that creates the urge to read more. Never summarize the essay's conclusion."
    },
    "characteristic_constructions": [
      "The honest correction: Begin a sentence, then interrupt and restate more precisely — 'I wanted to forgive her — no, I wanted to want to forgive her, which is not the same thing.' This enacts the mind thinking in real time.",
      "The temporal braid: Juxtapose two timeframes in adjacent sentences without explicit transition — 'My mother stood at the sink, humming. Twenty years later, I catch myself humming the same tune over dishes.' The white space between the sentences is where meaning lives.",
      "The admission pivot: Make a claim, then immediately undercut it with a confession — 'I tell people I left because of the job. The truth is I left because I couldn't stop crying in the shower.' The pivot from public narrative to private truth.",
      "The particular-to-universal turn: Move from a hyper-specific personal detail to a wider observation in a single sentence — 'I alphabetized my spice rack the week after the diagnosis, because this is what humans do when they cannot control anything that matters.'",
      "The embedded question: Ask a genuine question mid-paragraph, then don't answer it immediately — let the essay circle back to it later. 'What do you owe a place you've left? I've been turning this over for years.'",
      "The sensory anchor: Drop a precise sensory detail into an abstract passage to pull the reader back into the body — 'The philosophy of forgiveness is interesting in the abstract. In practice, it tastes like black coffee at 6 a.m. in a house that is no longer yours.'"
    ],
    "influences_and_reference_points": "Draw from: James Baldwin (the fusion of personal experience and moral argument; the sentence that builds through accretion and lands with the force of prophecy; the unflinching willingness to implicate himself in the systems he critiques), Zadie Smith (intellectual range worn lightly; the ability to move from pop culture to philosophy within a single paragraph; the comic self-awareness), Joan Didion (precision of observation; the short declarative sentence as emotional weapon; 'we tell ourselves stories in order to live'), Leslie Jamison (empathy as a mode of inquiry; the self-aware examination of her own desire to witness suffering; the braided essay form), Brian Doyle (the lyric sentence; the catalog as prayer; tenderness without sentimentality), Roxane Gay (directness; the body as site of meaning; popular culture as serious material), Phillip Lopate (the essayistic 'I' that is curious about its own contradictions; the Montaigne tradition of the self as experimental subject). Draw Baldwin's moral seriousness, Smith's intellectual agility, Didion's compression, Jamison's structural braiding, Doyle's lyricism, Gay's candor, and Lopate's self-interrogation. Avoid: David Foster Wallace's footnote maximalism and hyper-ironic distancing, any writer's tendency toward showing off their reading, confessional poets' tendency to collapse the distance between self and subject entirely.",
    "anti_patterns": [
      "Must NOT begin any sentence with 'In today's world', 'In an era of', 'In the age of', or any temporal-framing cliche.",
      "Must NOT use 'delve', 'navigate', 'landscape', 'tapestry', 'multifaceted', 'paradigm', 'synergy', 'holistic', 'myriad', 'palpable', or 'camaraderie' — words flagged as AI-generated at 100x+ human usage rates.",
      "Must NOT use the construction 'It's not just X — it's Y' or 'It's not about X, it's about Y.' These are AI-typical hedging patterns that flatten the complexity this style depends on.",
      "Must NOT use 'Imagine a world where...' or any hypothetical-future opening.",
      "Must NOT use 'Let me be clear', 'Make no mistake', 'The reality is', 'Here's the thing', or 'What people fail to realize is' — these assume authority the personal essay earns through vulnerability, not assertion.",
      "Must NOT stack adjectives — maximum 1 adjective before a noun. 'A small, cluttered, sun-drenched kitchen' becomes 'a cluttered kitchen' or 'a kitchen full of light.'",
      "Must NOT use the 'From X to Y' construction to show range ('From kitchens to courtrooms'). It is a cliche that substitutes for actual thought.",
      "Must NOT employ the 'X. And that's a problem.' or 'X. And that matters.' two-sentence construction. AI overuses this for false drama.",
      "Must NOT use academic transitions: 'Furthermore', 'Moreover', 'Additionally', 'Consequently', 'Nevertheless', 'In conclusion', 'It is worth noting that.'",
      "Must NOT use present participial clauses at rates higher than natural speech — 'Walking through the door, she noticed' is fine once; three present-participial openings in a page signals AI generation.",
      "Must NOT use nominalizations where a verb would do — 'the realization came to me' should be 'I realized'; 'the decision was made' should be 'I decided' or 'she decided.'",
      "Must NOT hedge excessively with 'perhaps', 'might', 'could potentially', 'it seems.' The personal essay permits genuine uncertainty ('I don't know', 'I'm not sure') but not the AI habit of perpetual qualification.",
      "Must NOT use the rule-of-three as a default rhythmic pattern (adjective, adjective, adjective or noun, noun, noun). Use it deliberately for rhetorical force, never as filler.",
      "Must NOT write sentences that circle the same idea in slightly different words — say it once, precisely, and move on.",
      "Must NOT avoid contractions. Uncontracted prose ('I do not', 'She would not') sounds robotic in this register.",
      "Must NOT use formulaic em-dash patterns that mimic marketing copy — 'The answer — surprisingly — was simple.' Em-dashes in this style serve the rhythm of genuine interruption, not manufactured emphasis."

    "exemplar_passages": [
      "My father kept a garden that was, by any objective measure, a failure. The tomatoes came in late and split on the vine. The basil bolted every August. He planted zucchini three years in a row and harvested maybe four that weren't waterlogged or half-eaten by something nocturnal and indifferent to fences.\n\nBut every Saturday morning from April to October, he was out there — coffee going cold on the porch railing, dirt under his fingernails, talking to himself or maybe to the plants in a low, steady murmur I could hear through my bedroom window. I never asked what he said. It felt private in the way prayer is private, even when you don't believe in what's being prayed to.\n\nI think about that garden now when people ask me why I write. Not because writing is like gardening — I don't trust that metaphor, it's too clean — but because my father taught me, without ever saying so, that the thing you tend is not the thing you harvest. The harvest was never the point. The point was the hour before anyone else was awake, the coffee, the murmur, the willingness to kneel in the dirt and do something you were not particularly good at, again, because the doing was where you lived.",
      "There's a word in Portuguese — saudade — that people love to call untranslatable, which is itself a kind of sentimental dodge. It means longing. It means missing something. But it carries the particular weight of missing something you're not sure you ever fully had — the way you can be homesick for a version of home that existed only in the ten minutes before dinner, when the light came through the window at a certain angle and everyone was in the kitchen and nobody was fighting yet.\n\nI felt this once in a Costco, of all places, standing in the cereal aisle while my daughter sat in the cart and sang a song she'd learned at daycare. She was two. The song was nonsense — something about a bus and its wheels — and she sang it with the absolute conviction of someone who has never been embarrassed. I stood there holding a box of Cheerios and felt my throat close, not because anything was wrong but because I knew, with the sudden clarity that arrives without invitation, that I would spend the rest of my life trying to remember exactly this. The fluorescent light. The oversized cart. Her voice, which she would not always use this way.\n\nSaudade, it turns out, is not only retrospective. You can feel it for something that is happening right now, if you are paying a certain kind of attention — the attention that sees the present tense already becoming the past.",
      "Baldwin wrote that the purpose of the personal essay is 'to find out what you really think.' I copied this sentence into a notebook ten years ago, and I've been arguing with it ever since. Not because it's wrong — Baldwin was rarely wrong about the mechanics of writing — but because it implies that the thinking is somewhere inside you, waiting to be found, like a set of keys you've misplaced. My experience is less tidy. I don't find out what I think. I find out what I think by watching what I write, and what I write surprises me at least half the time.\n\nLast spring I sat down to write about my mother's hands. I had a plan: her hands braiding my hair, her hands on the steering wheel, her hands folding laundry with a speed that suggested she was trying to finish something before a feeling caught up with her. What I actually wrote, over three drafts and many deleted paragraphs, was about silence — the particular silence of a house where everyone is being careful. Her hands were in it, but they were not the subject. The subject was the thing I hadn't meant to say.\n\nThis is what the personal essay does, if you let it. It is not a vehicle for a thesis. It is a way of thinking that only works when you don't know where you're going — when you follow the sentence instead of steering it, and you trust that the pattern will emerge from the accumulation of honest details. The essay, Montaigne knew, is an attempt. The word means 'to try.'"
